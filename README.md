# A simple telepresence robot

These are the code and design files for a simple telepresence robot that allows someone to remotely rotate a smartphone that's being used for videoconferencing so that they can see the whole room and focus on the person that's talking.  A detailed discussion of the project can be found [on my blog](https://saintgimp.org/2017/11/19/a-simple-telepresence-robot/).
